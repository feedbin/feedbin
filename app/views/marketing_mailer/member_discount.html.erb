<p>I'm offering a discount this month to everyone who's been interested in the past.</p>
<p><a href="XX">Give Feedbin another shot!</a> Follow your passions and never miss a post from your favorite sites. Try it free for two weeks, and pay just $25 a year if you like it - that's half off the new pricing.</p>
