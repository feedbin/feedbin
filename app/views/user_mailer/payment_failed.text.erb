Hi <%= @user.email %>,

There was a problem charging the credit card for your Feedbin account.

Please update your billing information on <%= settings_billing_url %>.

Thanks!

PS: If you have received this email multiple times and believe your credit card details are correct, it might be necessary to contact your bank to see about allowing future charges to go through.

Declined charges are left intentionally vague so there's not much information we can provide but please let us know if there is anything we can do to help.
